Scene graph implemetation

  architecture overview
    NodeObject ( base class )
  
    MeshObject : public NodeObject
      -mesh
      -material

    Camera : public NodeObject



    Rendering
      scene.Render
        NodeObject.Render

        MeshObject.Render(IRenderer renderer)
          calculate current modelMatrix  
          renderer.Render(Mesh, Material, ModelMatrix);

-shared_ptr

- mesh init should propably make from modelmanager when mesh is created 
  becose if it made in scene init method it can't be done in runtime.
  (then scene don't need initmeshes metod.)

  (or add scene listener when new object is added and call renderer init)


- shader creation (ShaderManager)
- material 
- lights 
- ObjectFactory register creator
- audio
- mesh loader
- skeletal animation
- collision ( bounding volume and the collision detection )

- meshobject hierarcy transformation( child object)
- follow camera

- event system
- controller

- texture's
- component system so that component can be registered 
- physics
  -body
  -force generator
  -physic manager

bsp tree, sceneGraph
- object select ( iselectable)
